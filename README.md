# Installation

Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository

    git clone https://github.com/Veeeetzzzz/pest-control-booking-system

Step 2: Install Node.js and npm

Ensure Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your machine. If not, download and install them from Node.js official website.

Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

Navigate to your project directory (where your project was cloned) and run:

    npm install

This command will install all the dependencies listed in your package.json file.

Step 4: Update Configuration Files

Open the authConfig.js file in your project.

Replace the placeholders in msalConfig with your actual Azure AD application details:
            
clientId: Your Azure AD application client ID.

authority: Your Azure AD authority URL, usually in the format https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your_tenant_id>.

redirectUri: The URI where Azure AD will redirect to after authentication. It should match what's configured in your Azure AD application.

Step 5: Run the Application

In the project directory, run:

        npm start

This command will start the React application. By default, it should be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Step 6: Deployment (Optional)

For deployment, you can use various services like Vercel, Netlify, or Azure Static Web Apps.

Each platform has its own set of instructions for deployment. Generally, you'll need to connect your GitHub repository and configure build settings.

Don't forget to update the redirectUri in your Azure AD application and authConfig.js to match your deployed application URL.

# Additional Notes:
Always ensure that your redirectUri in the Azure AD application settings matches the URI in your authConfig.js and the actual URL where your application is running or deployed.

Keep your clientId and other sensitive information secure. Avoid pushing these details to public repositories.
